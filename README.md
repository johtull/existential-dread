	The amount of sprint/super-jump energy you have. You recover stamina slowly over time. 
	If you run out, you will be temporarily incapacitated while you catch your breath.  
## BATTERY CHARGE - YELLOW BAR
	The amount of charge your lantern has. If you run out, you will not be able to use 
	your lantern until you find more batteries.  
  
OBJECTIVES

lantern is off, you will take damage. When your health is depleted, the game is over.

	You must fix your lantern by collecting its 5 broken parts.  
  
## LEVEL 2 - SUBWAY/SEWER:  
	You must traverse a maze. Collecting extra batteries may help.
